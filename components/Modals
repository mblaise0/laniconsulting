            <p>
              Africa has gone through many changes over the years, from the era of vibrant and diverse cultural kingdoms during the pre-colonial era, to the 
              colonial era and finally the era that lead to the gradual decolonisation of Africa. Since these dynamic periods, many changes have occurred across
              Africa in terms of infrastructure, education, science and technology, religion and tourism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sub-Saharan Africa in particular has seen remarkable but not enough change through her history; as a result it is far behind the world in general in
              various aspects. This has split the sub-Saharan society in two, the first part comprising of the elites or the higher class who live in an overabundance
              while the second part is comprised of the masses that live with an insufficiency of resources to survive their day to day life.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an African, I am passionate about the renaissance of an Africa devoid of drought, pictures of malnourished children and issues of corruption relating 
              to our political circles. It is time for the rebirth of a sub-Saharan Africa where entrepreneurship, technology, and the powerful youth drive a change worth discussing in the global sphere.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this reason, I am happy to support the development of positive change that presents Africa in a new light and dimension in collaboration with others, through the foundation, other initiatives,
              projects and programmes. Such projects could range from reshaping the view and image of our diverse cultural heritage to shedding light on our rich cultural background in areas such as our cuisine 
              and tourist sites; thus helping shape the values that make us African.

                  Every human being is a child before adulthood and we must collectively support the rights of children to health care, 
                  education and ensure that their basic human right is entrenched. We should do this through reforms and policy at the 
                  political sphere and also support social organisations that enable children’s right to be enhanced at the basic level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the last decade, through the WHRIN, I have supported the eradication of the abuse of child rights under the allegation
                  of witchcraft in Akwa Ibom state. This was done through the creation of forums and policies. I also continue to support through
                  the LANI Foundation, projects that enables orphans, marginalised children, those with physical disabilities and neurodiversity 
                  in particular, find a better place in the society. This was achieved by building a more stable environment for them to be nurtured
                  in, though ideally children should not be left to develop in orphanages but in a loving and stable family home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of my beliefs is that no child under 16 or 18 should be employed in a Nigerian household, if one wants to help a child, enrolling
                  that child in a school is the better thing to do. Child labour should be fought against so that we can help these children with more 
                  sustainable practices by offering them education and not domestic slavery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this reason, I am happy to support the development of positive change that presents Africa in a new light and dimension in collaboration with others, through the foundation, other initiatives,
                  projects and programmes. Such projects could range from reshaping the view and image of our diverse cultural heritage to shedding light on our rich cultural background in areas such as our cuisine 
                  and tourist sites; thus helping shape the values that make us African.

                  Our environment is important; I come from Nigeria’s greenbelt and believe we need to pursue endeavours that conserve and clean our environment. 
                  We cannot carry out actions without thinking of what the impact will be on our environment. So from the view of the plants, animals and the natural
                  systems around us, we need to figure out ways to not destroy and nullify the roles each of these elements play in the natural order of things. Thus, 
                  the need to teach our future generation how to be more involved in that conservation. Also being based in the agricultural sector, I am keen on the 
                  results of our activities on our environment.

                  Sehai Foods Ltd, a company I co-founded within the Apiculture value chain is focused on sustainable bee keeping practices in line with Sustainable 
                  Development Goals during the honey production process. Looking at the impact of beekeeping on the world we see that bees pollinate about 35% of crops
                  in the world. Beekeeping is one agricultural enterprise that despite being a profit entity helps in conserving our environment and thus in turn creates
                  conservation awareness in the sub-Saharan Africa. I am therefore interested at speaking and sharing thoughts in forums and events on how to better conserve our environment.

                  Disabilities are often overlooked in places such as Africa and I find it compelling to get involved as an activist in promoting the 
                  rights of persons with disabilities not just in sub-Saharan Africa but in the global arena.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, disability is being tackled using the Charity Model throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The Charity Model is not dependent 
                  on the existence of charities – but it does heavily inform many charities, especially ones focused on disability. It is concerned with
                  seeing disability as tragic and in need of support. The model is not about supporting disabled people to live our lives on our own terms;
                  it is not concerned with civil rights, independent living, meaningful employment or equal access to education.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are a number of charities for disabled people constructed on this basis, led by non-disabled people to help disabled people live better
                  lives or find cures. This is a problem as it not only means that services are not shaped by people who truly understand the needs of disabled 
                  people, but they also offer no role-modelling or alternative narratives for disabled people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Often “Charity Model” charities fundraise through imagery and messaging that shows disabled people as helpless and tragic – to generate emotive 
                  responses from non – disabled people who will hopefully feel enough pity to put their hands in their pocket. Though this may solve the immediate
                  needs of the individuals or groups concerned, it gives these people the role of liabilities in the society that people ought to consider because 
                  of their disabilities. No attention is given to the real needs of those with disabilities which is social acceptance and dreams of also pursuing 
                  realisable goals which in turn gives them a sense of purpose and value in the society.

                  Education is one of the best things we can ever give to the next generation. It should be about not just going to school but creating a suitable
                  environment for lifelong learning where we continue to learn throughout the trajectory of human life. However, a strong foundation particularly 
                  at early childhood cannot be overemphasised as it is during this period that we develop the grit and cognitive abilities that enables us to pursue
                  a fulfilling life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Education in sub-Saharan Africa must be recalibrated, as the current model is not geared towards a digital age. It does not provide learners with the
                  competence and the minimum skills required in the current digitally inclined workplace. A determination to further improve the currently crippled 
                  educational system has led me to solve one of the problems within the education ecosystem which is about the training of our teachers. I often say a
                  teacher is the most fundamental aspect of the education chain; one can train under a tree in Kenya but have a better outcome than those trained in a
                  beautiful classroom in Nigeria. So it is really about the teacher that is what led me to co-founded the Axiom Learning Solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, as an active practitioner and advocate, I continue to pursue the understanding of needs at grassroots that will lead to learning outcomes 
                  that encompasses localised solutions, problem-solving, innovative funding concepts as well as connections with global environment to create and implement
                  a curriculum that is all-encompassing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, there are other areas within education that are relatively important. One area I have interest in is education finance and under this, the question
                  is how we can give credit to people so that they can access education. It is an area I am constantly looking to collaborate and work with other people to 
                  create a significant social impact; either through a business, a social enterprise or public sector engagement.

                  The Efiks found in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states are one of the most civilised and dual documented ethnic groups in Africa. Calabar is seen to be 
                  a centre of culture and as a true son of the soil, I pursue an interest that covers and protects Efik language, culture, and custom as a way of preserving

                  in the global dimension, one must be firmly rooted in his/ her culture. I believe that this diversity through individual identity is what adds to the richness
                  of our connections and breadth of our experiences.

                  Our traditions are found in the language, the folklore, the poetry and the plays; we must however engage with our institutions and bastions of our cultural 
                  heritage to transform and remain progressive for future generations. In Nigeria for instance we must at the bare minimum support this through our four main 
                  centres of culture namely Benin, Calabar, Ife and Kano.

                  “Not everyone is an entrepreneur however, everybody can be part of the entrepreneurial experience” - ACB
                  So how does one on-board more people, even when one is not an entrepreneur, how can they be integrated into the journey. 
                  In the running of an enterprise there are different stages or phases of an entrepreneurial transaction which is carried out
                  by various individuals who are not entrepreneurs. These individuals can be integrated into the entrepreneurial journey as 
                  employers, investors, buyers of the goods and services or otherwise. The key thing is building those entrepreneurial 
                  relationships within that ecosystem, so the business is sustainable, then the employees and employers stay happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So it is a win-win solution for enterprise. But when we try to almost force people who are not entrepreneurs into it,
                  it does not work out. One thing I want to do in entrepreneurship is to encourage people who have ideas whether in terms 
                  of mentoring, funding or investment to help them get to where they need to be. Secondly, to make those who are not entrepreneurs
                  comfortable and also help them add value to enterprise. Personally, I also believe that within our businesses, we can still be 
                  “intrapreneurs” i.e. within the business, how do we maximise our entrepreneurship skills. We need to look at new models of enterprise
                  to make things different.

                  Entrepreneurs usually engage in business with a risk and reward mind-set, which has money-making as the end gain. But when looking at social entrepreneurship
                  we are looking at how to develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues. Social entrepreneurship has drawn interest from 
                  global policy makers and social entrepreneurs to target developing countries. Generally, not-for-profit organisations, funded by government and donor grants 
                  have played a significant role in poverty alleviation. It is all about: “Finding solutions to problems in the society on the journey of money-making”.

                  The aftermath of so-called “social impact investment” in sub-Saharan Africa has produced not enough result in battling the ever-growing scourge of poverty. Why?
                  In reality it takes two solid ends to build a reliable bridge. Efforts have been made by organisations in diaspora to improve the living conditions in sub-Saharan
                  Africa through endless innovative ways that give to the society but still the poverty rising levels of some countries grows ever stronger. This is as a result of 
                  the other end which is comprised of the local or African-based entrepreneurs not being nearly as reliable. We must always learn to give back to our communities, and
                  everyone who is an entrepreneur or runs a portfolio of entrepreneurial interest must support one cause or another. Yes, it is up to you and me to fulfil our part of 
                  the bargain and help in bringing social change within our countries across sub-Saharan Africa.
